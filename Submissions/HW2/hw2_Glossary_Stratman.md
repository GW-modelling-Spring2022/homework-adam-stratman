## Glossary Questions:
1. What is MODFLOW?  What is a MODFLOW package (provide at least 2 examples)?  What are the inputs to a MODFLOW model?

MODFLOW is a modular finite difference flow model.2 MODFLOW packages are horizontal flow barrier package and seawater intrusion package. Plugins to simulate a scenario. Inputs can be files, .bcf , .cbc - .nam calls and points to each one.

2. What is the relationship between head gradients and hydraulic conductivity in steady state systems?

head gradients go up when k goes down


3. What is a model node?  A model cell?  Use a simple diagram to show the relationship between heads defined at nodes and properties defined in cells.

a node is similiar to an representative elementary volume and a cell is the boundary of the rev.

4. What is the difference between TypeI and Type II boundary conditions and under what conditions might you use each? Provide at least 2 examples for locations where we might use Type I or Type II boundaries to represent a feature in the real world.

Type 1 boundary conditions are boundaries with specified head (Dirichlet conditions), type 2- boundary conditions are specified flow (neumann conditions). Lakes are type 1 boundary conditons.
